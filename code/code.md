# 📦 IoT Smart Bin Firmware (ESP32)

This is the firmware code for an **IoT-Based Smart Bin** built on the ESP32 platform, integrated with various sensors to monitor garbage level, environmental conditions, and movement, and send real-time data to **ThingSpeak** for smart waste management.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🔴 **LED Alerts** based on bin fill level:
  - **Red**: High (urgent cleaning)
  - **Yellow**: Medium
  - **Green**: Low
- 📏 **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects bin fill level
- 🌡️ **DHT11 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity
- 👁️ **PIR Sensor**: Detects nearby motion or presence
- ☁️ **ThingSpeak Integration**: Sends data to cloud for visualization

## 🌐 Cloud Configuration (ThingSpeak)

Make sure to:
- Create a ThingSpeak channel
- Note down your **API key** and **Channel ID**
- Map fields as follows:
  - `field1`: Temperature
  - `field2`: Humidity
  - `field3`: Garbage Fill Level (%)
  - `field4`: PIR Sensor Value

---

## 📶 Wi-Fi Setup

Update the following lines with your Wi-Fi credentials in the code:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

---

## 📤 Sending Data to ThingSpeak

Data is sent every **15 seconds** using the ESP32's built-in Wi-Fi via HTTP POST requests.

**POST Data Format:**

```
api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&field1=<temperature>&field2=<humidity>&field3=<fill_level>&field4=<pir_value>
```

## 🧠 Logic Overview

1. Measure distance using Ultrasonic sensor and calculate garbage fill level.
2. Read environment data from DHT11 and motion from PIR.
3. Light up the appropriate LED based on fill level.
4. Send all sensor readings to ThingSpeak.

## 🛡️ Safety Note

This code includes a basic reconnection mechanism for Wi-Fi. Consider adding more robust error handling and OTA updates for production use.
