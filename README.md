# IoT-Based Smart Bin for Smart Cities

An innovative IoT-based smart waste management system developed as part of a smart city initiative. This smart bin helps municipal authorities optimize garbage collection routes by monitoring bin levels and environmental conditions in real time.

## 🚀 Overview

The smart bin utilizes sensors and visual indicators to monitor waste levels and environmental data. Colored lights (Red, Yellow, Green) alert the public to take action or notify authorities when bins are full.

### 🔴 Visual Indicators

- **Red Light** – High garbage level (urgent cleaning required)  
- **Yellow Light** – Medium garbage level  
- **Green Light** – Low garbage level  

These indicators help passersby identify the bin status at a glance.

## 🔧 Key Sensors & Components

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor**  
   - Measures garbage level by detecting distance from the top of the bin.

2. **PIR Sensor**  
   - Detects presence of living beings to prevent accidental or hazardous waste disposal.

3. **DHT11 Sensor**  
   - Measures internal temperature and humidity inside the bin.

4. **ESP32 Microcontroller**  
   - Collects and transmits sensor data to the cloud platform (ThingSpeak).

## ☁️ Cloud Integration

- All sensor data is sent to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring and visualization.
- Municipal authorities can access this data remotely to:
  - Monitor garbage fill levels
  - Detect environmental changes
  - Track PIR activity
  - Prioritize and optimize waste collection routes
